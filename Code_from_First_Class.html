    <h2>Lists</h2>

      <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
          <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
          <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
          <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
          <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
          <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
              an ordered list</li>
        </ol>
